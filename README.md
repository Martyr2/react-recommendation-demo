# React Slider Demo

This is a simple responsive react slider demo for showing recommendations on your website. I wanted an easy to display recommendation widget that could showcase all the wonderful reviews I get from my clients and business associates. This demo showcases how to use overrideable styling through props to change colors.<br/><br/>

## About the frontend:

It has several features including the following:

- Customizable colors through three props: backgroundColor, glowColor and image outlineColor.
- Easy to customize slide data (found in the src > components > slideData.js file)
- Adjustable speed transition between slides
- Jump to slide toggle on the widget
- This demo is also coded using Typescript for better error checking at design time.

## Additional feature considerations:

If you are interested and wanted to take this to the next level, you could do the following things...

- Support the ability to click avatars to go to their LinkedIn profile (or yours where the recommendation is displayed)
- Change the direction by which the slide slides in and out
- Add further styling options through props
